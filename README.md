# Project for Computer Graphics Class
This project was developed as the final work of the Computer Graphics class on the Computer Science course.

## LearnOpenGL
The project puts together all the tutorials of Breakout Game available on [https://learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout) to construct a game.
Check the oficial LearnOpenGL [repository](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL) for more samples of other tutorials (Breakout not included).

## Compatibility
This is a Visual Studio project and all relevant libraries are found in /libs and all DLLs found in /Debug. Most part of the linking in project are configured with relative paths already, so it might work independent of the project folder location.
